# GoLift: A Scalable Load Balancing Solution in Go

### Different Load Balancing Algorithms

1. Round Robin: Distributes requests evenly across all servers, regardless of their current load.
2. Weighted Round Robin: Similar to Round Robin but considers the capacity of each server, allocating more requests to higher-capacity servers.
3. Least Connections: Directs new requests to the server with the fewest active connections, aiming for a fair distribution based on current load.

### Why Am I Choosing the Least Connection Algorithm?

1. Efficiency in High Traffic: Thrives under variable load conditions, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed.
2. Fair Load Distribution: Ideal for when servers have differing capacities, as it considers the current server load rather than a fixed rotation or capacity.
3. Dynamic Adaptability: Automatically adjusts to changes in server availability or traffic patterns, making it suitable for environments with fluctuating demands.
4. Enhanced User Experience: Minimizes response times by avoiding overloaded servers, leading to faster, more reliable service delivery.

### Ideal Scenario

In a distributed, high-traffic environment, such as an e-commerce platform during a flash sale, the Least Connections method can prevent server overload by dynamically distributing incoming requests to the least busy servers, ensuring smooth and efficient operation even under intense demand.

### Algorithmic Explanation
GoLift employs the Least Connections algorithm for optimal request distribution:

1. Identify Servers: Select servers with the lowest active connections.
2. Round-Robin Tiebreaker: If multiple servers share the lowest count, employ Round Robin to assign the request.
3. Single Server Assignment: Directly assign the request to a lone server with the fewest connections.

### Advantages
1. Reduced Server Overload: Prioritizes servers with fewer connections, mitigating overload risks.
2. Enhanced Reliability: Offers more responsive and reliable service compared to rotation-based methods.

### Limitations
1. Troubleshooting Complexity: Non-deterministic nature complicates diagnostics.
2. Increased Processing: Requires more computation for decision-making.
3. Capacity Ignorance: Does not account for server capacity, potentially mis-allocating resources.
